**This project is an assignment (Assignment 1) in the course Programming in C#, III-HT20 (Course Code: DA208E) at Malm√∂ University, Sweden.**

Gallery organizer is a simple gallery app where users can create virtual albums (each album has a title, description and later: ability to change the album default thumbnail).
The application won't move any media files from their original path but rather saves the path of these files in a virtual folder (list). 
Album contents are displayed in single album window. Album contents can be played in a slideshow window.
